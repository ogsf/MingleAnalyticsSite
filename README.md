Selenium tests with C# and NUnit for mingleanalytics.com. A basic POC.

Initial commit contains setup and teardown in .cs file. 
The .cs file contains numerous TODOs' to move setup/teardown to a separate 
utility file, setup page object class(es), refactor code with arrays' and iterators etc.

Ultimate goal is to build a framework using SpecFlow, SpecRunner, Watin and PageObjects.

This intial effort is simply to get some web tests running using Team Foundation Studio, C#, 
Selenium and NUnit. It ain't pretty (yet), but it works. - Kevin 9/29/15
